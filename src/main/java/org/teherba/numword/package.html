<a target="_top" href="/webapps/numword/"><strong>numword</strong></a>    writes numbers (sequences of decimal digits, up to (10^6)^20) as number words 
    in more than 30 natural languages,
    and converts such number words back to digit sequences. 
    Several other entities like the names of weekdays, months and seasons 
    are also mapped to numbers and vice versa. The word generator uses 
    word tables and triple-digit oriented algorithms for most languages
    (with many exceptions, especially for far-east languages and Klingon).
    The number word parser uses a single general algorithm, however.
