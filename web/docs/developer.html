    <h2>Hints for Developers</h2>
    <p><a href="../index.jsp"><strong>numword</strong></a> 
    handles numbers only in a limited number of 
    western european languages, and though English, German and French 
    were tested rather thoroughly, there may be remaining mistakes in all
    language classes.
    </p>
    <p>
    You are strongly encouraged to:
    <ul>
    <li>play with the language modules,</li>
    <li>email any hints for improvement,</li>
    <li>contribute patches for corrections,</li>
    <li>contribute new language classes.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Please try to remain close to the current programming style:
    <ul>
    <li>Determine the correct 3-letter ISO 636 code for the language,
    and name the new Java class accordingly. Also look out for 
    a 2-letter language code, and enter both codes in the call of method
    <em>setIso636</em> in the constructor.</li>
    <li>Copy the Java source file for an existing language
    which is close to the new language.</li>
    <li>Extend <em>BaseSpeller</em> or one of the generic subclasses
    like <em>SlavicSpeller</em>.</li>
    <li>Enter the new language class in the
    constructor of <em>NumberSpeller</em>. It will automatically appear in the
    list box of the web application.</li>
    <li>Try to put any fixed strings for parts of number words in
    the arrays <em>wordN...</em> or put them into the morphem hashmap
    with <em>putMorphem</em>. In that way you will automatically 
    get the parsing of number words as soon as you finish the generation of 
    number words for the language.</li>
    <li>Write Javadoc comments before all methods and public members.</li>
    <li>Note that all Java sources for this application are compiled with:
<pre>
    &lt;javac  srcdir="${src.home}" destdir="${build.classes}" listfiles="yes"
            encoding="utf8"
            source="1.4" target="1.4"
            debug="${javac.debug}" debuglevel="${javac.debuglevel}"&gt;
</pre>
    Determine the proper accents and non-ASCII characters, and write them
    in Unicode in the Java source files. 
    Have a look at the <a href="/numword/unicode.jsp?unicode=01">Unicode
    tables</a> as they are displayed in your browser.
    Use an Unicode enabled editor that handles 
    UTF-8 properly. Write some Unicode characters in the header comment 
    such that the editor can detect the UTF-8 encoding.</li>
    <li>Use reliable sources for the word lists (much of the current material is from
    Wikipedia). Avoid dialects.
    Pick the number words for 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and search for them altogether 
    in the Internet to get pages with number word lists.
    </li>
    <li>Determine whether the language
    uses the million, milliard ... (French) or the million, billion ... (American) scheme.
    Make sure how spaces, hyphens, particles like "and" etc. 
    are inserted in the wording for bigger numbers. 
    Decide whether to use "one hundred, one thousand" or "hundred, thousand" only.
    </li>
    <li>Generate the list of all test numbers and check whether parsing them 
    yields the same numbers.
    </li>
    </ul>
